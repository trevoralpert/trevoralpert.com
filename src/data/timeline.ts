export const finalTimelineText = "Rideshare came out in 2023 in the midst of the WGA Strike. Ever since then the entertainment industry has yet to bounce back to where it was when I first moved to LA when there was a lot more opportunity. Over the course of the next 2 years, I continued to work in service jobs to pay off the budget of the web series while promoting it. I was offered a few streaming deals from some up and coming streaming services but none of the offers were enough to cover the cost of production and they wanted to own the web series and the intellectual property. This was the point where I realized I had to make a change in my direction in life. I've been so fulfilled in my creative pursuits but it's become clear that in the current industry climate there's no way for someone to break in without already being established and with Artificial Intelligence on the horizon it doesn't seem like it's going to get any better in the long run. So I thought to myself where can I be creative and get onto the forefront of something new? Well the same thing that would've eventually taken my job if I stayed in entertainment: Artificial Intelligence.";
